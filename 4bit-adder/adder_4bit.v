// 4-bit ripple carry adder: 4 full adders chained together.
// The carry-out of each stage feeds the carry-in of the next, which is why
// it's called "ripple carry" - the carry has to ripple through every stage
// before the final result is valid. Simple, but slow for wide adders since
// each bit has to wait on the one before it.
